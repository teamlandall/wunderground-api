# wunderground-api 

Instructions: 

- Build a web app that uses the Weather Underground API (https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs) to get the current weather:
- Allow the user to check the current weather conditions for a city.
- Display the current temperature and a description, e.g. "Partly Cloudy".
- Use the "conditions" API endpoint.
